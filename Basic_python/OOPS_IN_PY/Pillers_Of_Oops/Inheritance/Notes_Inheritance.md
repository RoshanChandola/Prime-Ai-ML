inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called the parent or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

the main advantage of inheritance is that it allows you to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and behaviors while adding new features or modifying existing ones.

we have different types of inheritance in python:

1. single inheritance: In single inheritance, a child class inherits from a single parent class. This is the simplest form of inheritance and establishes a straightforward hierarchical relationship between the parent and child classes.

2. multilevel inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a derived class, which in turn inherits from another base class. This creates a chain of inheritance where each class can inherit properties and methods from its parent class.

3. multiple inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a child class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows the child class to combine features and behaviors from multiple base classes.

4. hierarchical inheritance: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class. This creates a hierarchy where the parent class serves as a common base for several derived classes.

5. hybrid inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It allows for more complex relationships between classes by combining features of single, multilevel, multiple, and hierarchical inheritance.
